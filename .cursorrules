iOS 18.4, Swift 6.0, Xcode 16.3
Architecture: MVVM with SwiftData
State Management: @Observable, @Model, @Environment, @StateObject
Async operations using async/await, network requests via URLSession (no third-party libraries)

📦 Code Requirements
All modules must be testable and maintainable
Static screens will be replaced with API-driven views without breaking current login functionality
Existing structure should be respected while enhancing UI

🎨 UI/UX Design
Visuals must stay minimalistic and modern

Light & Dark mode support is mandatory
Use soft blue, white, and gray tones to reflect trust and cleanliness
Button targets: minimum 44x44pt for accessibility

🧩 Core Screens

Drug Listing: Filterable, editable list with visual thumbnails
Add Drug: Form with name, description, expiry date, photo, and price

🧠 Bonus Recommendations
Use #Preview macros for each screen
Include mock data models for UI previews
Structure API layer with a service protocol pattern, e.g.:
protocol NetworkService {
    func fetchDrugs() async throws -> [Drug]
}

Tüm işlemlerde Apple'ın swiftin veya kullandığımız tüm teknolojilerin son sürümlerine göre hareket et. Bu kısım çok önemli.
